# Koch Snowflake Visualizer ❄️ (Spring Boot)

This project visualizes the **Koch Snowflake**, a famous fractal, using **Java Spring Boot**, **Thymeleaf**, **HTML Canvas**, and **Lombok**.

## 🧠 Inspiration
I was attending Professor Saty's class where we explored the Koch curve and its elegant geometry. As a beginner in Java, I used this opportunity to learn how to:

- Build and ship projects using **Java Spring Boot**
- Use **Lombok** to reduce boilerplate
- Work with HTML Canvas to visualize fractals

## 🚀 Features
- Dynamic **depth** and **edge** control from frontend
- Responsive and centered layout
- Powered by recursive geometry generation
